# Multisequence Alignment

This project implements a greedy progressive multiple sequence aligner, 
including the following functionalists: 
- Sequence-to-sequence global alignment 
- Sequence-to-profile alignment 
- Profile-to-profile alignment 

This is my final project for 
[CS 466 Introduction to Bioinformatics](http://www.el-kebir.net/teaching/CS466.html) 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Fall 2018.
