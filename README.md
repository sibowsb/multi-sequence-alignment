# Multisequence Alignment

This project implements a heuristic greedy progressive multiple sequence 
aligner, including the following functionalists: 
- Sequence-to-sequence global alignment 
- Sequence-to-profile alignment 
- Profile-to-profile alignment 

This is my final project for 
[CS 466 Introduction to Bioinformatics](http://www.el-kebir.net/teaching/CS466.html) 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Fall 2018.

I have benchmarked this implementation against the 
[`SeqAlign`](https://github.com/niemasd/SeqAlign) implementation by `niemasd`.
Since `SeqAlign` does not have an open source license (as of 12/11/2018), I 
did not include it in this repository. To reproduce my results you need to
clone `SeqAlign` yourself.
